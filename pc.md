## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a distributed, open-source version control system (VCS) that enables you to store code, track revision history, merge code changes, and revert to earlier code version when needed.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? We create a branch because it allows us to isloate changes from the master branch.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Pull Request informs others that changes has been pushed to a branch on a repository on Github.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. It is Git Checkout Command.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. Git fetch fetches changes, git pull merges after fetching. Git merge is what git fetch is initally. 
 What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
 How do you resolve a merge conflict? Opening up a conflicted file and making the necessary changes.
